                    <strong>Literature: </strong> Castles have been a recurring motif in literature,
                    especially in
                    fantasy and historical fiction genres. They often serve as central settings for epic
                    adventures,
                    romance, and intrigue. Novels like "The Lord of the Rings" by J.R.R. Tolkien and "A Song of
                    Ice
                    and Fire" by George R.R. Martin feature grand castles that play major roles in shaping the
                    plot.
                    In these stories, castles are often portrayed as imposing structures filled with secrets,
                    hidden
                    passages, and dramatic histories.
