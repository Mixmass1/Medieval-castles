        <h2>How castles became what they are?</h2>
        <p>Originating in the early medieval period, castles emerged as more than just fortresses; they evolved into
            multifunctional and awe-inspiring structures that played crucial roles in shaping the socio-political
            landscape of their respective regions. As the centuries passed, these impressive architectural marvels took
            on significant importance, acting as centers of power, governance, and culture.

                </div>
                <p>"Every castle has a story to tell, each brick and tower bearing witness to the tales of the ages."
                </p>
            </div>
            <br>
            Beyond their primary function of providing protection during turbulent times, castles became symbolic
            representations of authority, embodying the strength and influence of the ruling elite. Their towering walls
            and imposing turrets served as powerful statements of both military might and social prestige. Local
            communities looked up to these majestic structures as the very heart of their existence, a constant reminder
            of their identity and collective strength.

                        <p>Hohenzollern castle, built in 11th century, was an important castle in medieval times. Today
                            is a
                            famous tourist attraction.</p>

            <br> <br>
            <p>Beyond the practical aspects, the grandiosity of castles left an indelible mark on the imagination of the
                local population. Tales of heroism and valor, associated with the castle's defenders and knights,
                circulated
                throughout the region, inspiring both fear and admiration among the populace. The castles, with their
                lofty
                towers and mighty walls, stood as tangible representations of a bygone era, connecting the present to
                the
                rich tapestry of history.<br> <br> Over time, the architecture of castles evolved, adapting to the
                changing
                military tactics and political landscapes. Some transformed into opulent palaces, representing not only
                strength but also luxury and sophistication. Their courtyards became centers of artistic patronage,
                fostering creativity and innovation in various artistic disciplines, from architecture and painting to
                literature and music.

            <h2>First Forts in History</h2>
            <p>As we already said, castles are a type of fortifications and first forts existed even in the ancient
                times
                where various civilizations built protections to defend themselves from enemies. Early forts provided
                enough
                protection for settlements. These first forts usually consisted of walls that typically surrounded a
                city or
                a village. <br> <br> Now many differences between forts and castles were built later. Forts and castles
                have
                the same defensive purpose, but they have differences in structure, design, and their roles. Forts are
                often
                pretty smaller, and used for military purposes, while castles were mainly used as the seat for nobility,
                a
                center of governance, and a refuge for people in surrounding areas. Forts also didn’t have advanced
                defensive elements like those in castles. </p>

            <h2>Castles in medieval times</h2>
            <p>During the Middle Ages castles became popular, this had to do with a lot of different factors including
                politics and military operations. In this period castles evolved to adapt to changes in military tactics
                and
                advancements in technology. Knowing that we can divide the history of castles into a three different
                parts:
            <div class="redni">
                <h3>1. Early Middle Ages:</h3>
                <p>During the Early Middle Ages (5th to 10th centuries) the centralized authority declined. This was the
                    time of barbaric invasions so people needed protection in case of attack. Early castles were often
                    built
                    on existing Roman fortifications and were made of wood. They served as the residence of local lords
                    and
                    provided a means of defense against external threats. The first castle was Doue-la-Fontaine, located
                    in
                    Normandy, northern France.</p>

                    <p>Some of the earliest castles were of the <em><strong>motte and bailey</strong></em> design. A
                        <strong>motte</strong> was a raised mound (often artificial) with a wooden tower on top, while
                        the <strong>bailey</strong> was an enclosed courtyard next to the motte. This design provided
                        defensive advantages and was relatively quick to construct.

                <h3>2. High Middle Ages:</h3>
                <p>During the High Middle Ages (11th to 13th centuries) castles became more popular. The power of the
                    nobility increased while the power of centralized authority declined. This was also the time when
                    conquerors like Hungarians, Vikings, and others were constantly invading and pillaging lands in
                    Europe.
                    Because of that noblemans needed protection from them. So they started building castles all around
                    Europe in the 10th and 11th centuries. In the begging wood was the main building material but was
                    later
                    replaced by stone, because it’s stronger and isn’t flammable. <br> <br> The first castles were known
                    as
                    motte and bailey castles and they included motte, an elevated land surrounded by a canal, commonly a
                    natural hill, bailey which was the space within walls and keep. Keep quickly became the most iconic
                    part
                    where everything important was located (like administrative rooms, dining rooms, bedrooms…). Castles
                    quickly became common in the whole of Europe and a symbol of power and status.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p class="ffhead">Spiral Staircases Were Defensive</p>
                    <p>Many castles had <strong>spiral staircases</strong> that wound clockwise as you ascended. This
                        was deliberate, as most people are <em>right-handed</em>. It meant that defenders, who were
                        often positioned on the higher floors, had more space to swing their swords and easier access to
                        the wall, while attackers coming up would find their sword arm hindered.

                <h3>3. Late Middle Ages:</h3>
                <p>In the Late Middle Ages (14th and 15th centuries), castles underwent further transformations. The
                    invention of gunpowder and the evolution of siege warfare meant that the castle needed modifications
                    in
                    design. Thick walls and towers were built to withstand cannons, and other elements like arrow slits
                    and
                    gun loops were established to help defenders. Life also became better and more luxurious, with
                    larger
                    living quarters, grand halls, and decorations.</p>
                <br> <br> <br>
                <p>During the High middle ages two very different types of castles appeared, Romanesque (1066-1200) and
                    Edwardian
                    (1200-1300).</p>
                <h3>I Romanesque </h3>
                <p> It was the first type. They consisted of a single simple wall, which means that the defense was very
                    weak. Rooms were very cold and dark, windows were small, and very little light could go inside. This
                    type of castle was uncomfortable for people inside.</p>
                <h3>II Edwardian</h3>
                <p> This type had more and stronger walls which led to the creation of Concentric Castles and which were
                    harder for the enemy to capture. They featured more defensive mechanisms whose purpose was to
                    withstand
