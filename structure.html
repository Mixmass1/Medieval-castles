        <p>One of the most striking features of castles is their strategic precision, ingeniously designed to withstand
            sieges and repel invaders. The imposing walls, watchtowers, and moats were ingeniously crafted to provide
            formidable defenses, making them virtually impenetrable. The architectural ingenuity displayed in the
            construction of these fortresses continues to inspire awe and admiration.

        </div>
        <br>
        Their structure is very complex. To defend against enemy armies, castles had to upgrade their defense and adapt
        to new technologies and military tactics, so many features of a castle were added later and were not present in
        early versions.

                    <p>Castles had unique <em>bathrooms</em> known as <strong>garderobes</strong>. These were
                        essentially protruding stone structures built outside the main walls, and waste would drop down

                    even
                    included small passageways. The curtain wall featured many additional defensive features such as:

                            <strong>Arrow slits </strong> were ingenious defensive openings in castle walls,

                            openings, later cross-shaped designs were added, offering more versatile angles to

                            enemies and protection from enemy fire. These cleverly engineered slits were

                            though their practical use diminished over time, arrow slits remain a testament to

                            <strong>Battlements</strong>, with their crenellated design, were iconic features of

                            elevated position served as lookout points. The sight of battlements also acted as a

                            to potential attackers. Although their practical use diminished over time, their legacy

                            <strong>Towers</strong> were used so defenders could resist from higher ground. In the

                        <p>While many people associate castles with gray stone, they were
                            often <em>quite colorful</em> in medieval times. The exterior surfaces were often
                            covered with a
                            layer of plaster, which could be painted in vibrant colors. This was not just for
                            aesthetics but also a way to display the wealth and prestige of the castle's owner.
                        </p>

            <br>
            <div class="reveal">
                <p>Later another layer of walls was added and a <em>castle in a castle</em> was born. Attackers now had
                    to
                    capture both walls to enter inside. Two walls could be connected by underground tunnels, also called
                    <em>dungeons</em>.

                <div class="redni">
                    <h3>2. Fortified Gatehouse:</h3>
                    <p>The main gate of a castle was on the first line of defense and for this reason needed to be
                        strong to
                        protect the castle. They were surrounded by two towers on both sides. There were usually two
                        gates
                        that
                        could be closed by portcullises (metal grid which could be lowered to block passage). If enemies
                        were
                        stuck between two gates, they would’ve been killed through murder holes, holes in walls made so
                        that
                        defenders can shoot arrows through them. They were connected to land by a drawbridge, which
                        could be
                        raised to additionally protect the main gate.</p>

                        <p>A canal that was dug to surround the castle and could be filled with water. The moat was a

                            problem
                            for the enemy, it was around 1 meter deep, enough to disable cavalry from crossing, also

                            slippy

                            many

                        <p>It was usually the tallest building and certainly the most important. The Keep housed great
                            halls,
                            bedrooms, storage rooms, offices, and other important rooms. It was born in Normandy,
                            northern
                            France,
                            where local lords ignored the popular motte and bailey castles built in England. They were
                            normally
                            2-4
                            floors high and squared-shaped. Entranced was on higher ground connected with stairs to the
                            ground
                            which
                            could be removed in case of attack. Inside there was normally a great hall, used for meals
                            and
                            amusement, a chapel, used mainly for prayers, private apartments, and storage rooms.</p>

                            <p>Early castles lacked the chimneys we're familiar with today. The fire was built in the
                                middle of a room, and the smoke found its way out through a hole in the roof or simply
                                filled the space. Chimneys, as we know them now, were introduced in the later medieval
                                period and were considered a luxury.
                            </p>

                        <p>Lurking beneath the castle, the dungeons were dark and foreboding chambers designed to
                            imprison
                            captives
                            or enemies. Often damp and inhospitable, these grim spaces were a stark reminder of the
                            castle's
                            authority and the consequences of defying its might.</p>
