            <h2>What are castles?</h2>
            <p>Throughout history, castles have held a significant role as both architectural marvels and symbols of
                prestige. These formidable structures, crafted with strategic precision and artistic brilliance, have
                left a
                lasting impact on the collective imagination of people around the globe. Dating back to medieval times,
                castles served a crucial purpose as fortified structures, acting as defensive and protective
                fortifications
                for their esteemed residents.
                <br> <br>
                While forts were primarily military installations, castles went beyond that, serving as opulent
                residences
                for powerful figures such as rulers and nobles. The design of castles incorporated a multitude of
                features
                that not only added to their grandeur but also made them highly resilient against potential sieges and
                attacks. Towering walls provided an imposing fa√ßade, while sturdy keeps acted as the heart of these
                imposing
                structures.
                <br> <br>
                An essential feature of many castles was the presence of a moat encircling the fortress. This
                water-filled
                defensive ditch acted as a formidable obstacle for any would-be invaders, preventing direct access to
                the
                castle walls and enhancing its security. Bridges or drawbridges were often built across the moat,
                serving as
                the sole point of entry and exit, further fortifying the stronghold.
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>Purpose</h2>
            <p>Castles served as administrative centers, where rulers could administer justice, collect taxes, manage
                resources, and govern their territories effectively. They included courtrooms, administrative offices,
                storage facilities but also living areas, kitchens, dining areas and as well grand hall and chapel. <br>
                <br> Another purpose was to serve as a defense for people inside. In an era of constant threats of
                invasion,
                castles provided safety during conflicts. The presence of a fortified stronghold acted as a deterrent to
                potential attackers, as capturing a castle was a tough and costly campaign.¬†Building a castle was also
                tough
                and costly and required years and years. They were owned by lords who often spent around 50% of their
                wealth
                to build one.

            </div>
            <br>
            <p>The ideal position of a castle was on top of a hill, cliff, or along the river. These were important
                because
                they provided natural barriers for enemies who had to overcome them and provided expansive views over
                the
                local areas. This enabled people to oversee the surrounding areas and notice enemy armies in time.</p>

        <p>Because castles were usually surrounded by ditches called moats, a river would be a good option. It
            provided
            protection typically from 2 or 3 sides and was also a good source of water and fish. Castles were built
            by
            serfs
            who worked on lands owned by their lords. Transporting all of the material needed on harsh terrain was
            the
            main
            problem builders had to overcome.</p>
