        <h2>How did castles adapt to new era?</h2>
        <p>As the Renaissance appeared in Europe, feudalism declined and centralized authority gained power. Castles
            found themselves in a very uneasy situation, they lost their main purpose as they could no longer withstand
            the power of mighty artillery. As time passed, castles underwent various transformations, adapting to the
            changing demands of warfare and societal dynamics. Some were expanded and fortified, while others were
            converted into palatial residences or museums, preserving their historical significance for future
            generations to appreciate. This is what happened to most of them:</p>

                    <strong>Renovation and Transformation:</strong> Various castles were renovated and
                    transformed
                    to
                    serve new functions. As they lost their purpose they were modified into stately homes or
                    palaces
                    by
                    noble families. They underwent many renovations to adapt to the changing social and
                    architectural
                    tastes of the time. Elements of Renaissance, Baroque, or Neo-Classical were integrated into
                    the
                    existing medieval structures.

                <p>With the advent of gunpowder and artillery, the traditional castle design began to change.
                    The
                    thick stone walls and high towers were vulnerable to cannon fire. As a result, many castles
                    evolved into more practical, fortified residences that focused on comfort as well as
                    defense.
                    This transition marked the end of the traditional medieval castle era

                    <strong>Abandonment:</strong> With the decline of feudalism, some castles were abandoned by
                    their
                    owners, and their fate was left to nature. As they slowly decayed, they also became an
                    inspiration
                    for many artists.
